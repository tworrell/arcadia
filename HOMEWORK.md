- Checkout a copy of this repo.
- Use IRB, require the "character" class and make a bunch of characters
- Read about Ruby classes
- Read about `attr_accessor`
- Play around with IRB and define some methods using `def`. For example:

```ruby
def add_two(x)
  x + 2
end

add_two(100)
add_two(0)
add_two("this should explode")
```
